Task allocation in multi-robot systems based on auction method

Large plants such as factories, hospitals, warehouses etc. often use devices or robots that automatically do the works. Such plants often run into problems with
organization and task allocation when using multi-robot systems. This bachelor thesis researches one of the methods that provides optimal task scheduling -
the auction method. The main issue is addressed first, then theoretical settings of algorithms and program implementation. The results of the developed method
are presented on 5 different examples that differ and which should confirm the correctness of the auction method. In the end, it was concluded that the method,
with all its advantages and disadvantages, provides an optimal schedule of tasks.
